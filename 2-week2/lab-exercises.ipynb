    "This notebook uses 2019 flight statistics from the United States Department of Transportationâ€™s Bureau of Transportation Statistics (available [here](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FMF&QO_fu146_anzr=Nv4%20Pn44vr45) and in this repository as `data/T100_MARKET_ALL_CARRIER.zip`). Each row contains information about a specific route for a given carrier in a given month (e.g., JFK &rarr; LAX on Delta Airlines in January). There are 321,409 rows and 41 columns. Note that you don't need to unzip the file to read it in with `pd.read_csv()`."
